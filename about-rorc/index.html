    <h1>Recent History of the Ruth Obenchain Recreation Center</h1>

    <p>
      The Ruth Obenchain Recreation Center sits in the middle of Bly, Oregon. For many years it was known simply as the
      Gearhart Gym, a place where people played ball, gathered for events, and spent time together. Its history is tied
      closely to the town, and the effort to bring it back shows what a small community can do when people care enough to
      try.
    </p>

    <h2>A Gym's Silent Years</h2>
    <p>
      For almost five years the building sat locked and unused. The gym had once been part of the Klamath County School
      District, originally deeded to the district by the Edsall family more than 85 years ago. Declining enrollment and
      the cost of upkeep eventually led to its closure in 2012. The original deed included a clause saying that if the
      property went unused for two years, it would return to the Edsall family. The family did not want it back, but the
      clause created a legal situation that made transferring the property difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time the building continued to decline. The roof leaked, plumbing failed, and windows broke. Many
      people assumed the gym was finished and that nothing more would come of it.
    </p>

    <h2>The Legislation That Changed Everything</h2>
    <p>
      In 2015 Senate Bill 953 was signed into law, giving the school district a way to clear the title and transfer the
      building. This opened the first real opportunity in years for the gym to be used again. The Bly Community Action
      Team, a local nonprofit that supports community projects, recognized that the building could possibly be saved if
      people were willing to work together.
    </p>

    <h2>A Teenager's Determination</h2>
    <p>
      Around this time, 15-year-old Quentin Nichols posted online about the gym's condition. The post was simple, but it
      brought attention back to a building many people had almost forgotten about. It encouraged a conversation in town
      about whether the gym was worth trying to save.
    </p>
    <p>
      A community meeting followed, giving residents a chance to talk through ideas and concerns. This effort caught the
      attention of Leda Hunter, a member of BLY CAT, who saw potential in bringing the gym back into use. Working with
      Quentin and other members of the group, including Donna Kness and Chrissy Holgate, the team began putting together
      information and looking at what would be needed to restore the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leda's experience with grants and project coordination helped the group create a clear plan to present to the
      Klamath County School Board. On July 21, 2016, Leda and Quentin presented the proposal. The board voted unanimously
      to transfer the gym to BLY CAT, giving the community the chance to start bringing it back.

    <h2>Leading a Community Revival</h2>
    <p>
      At 15 years old, Quentin helped spark the push to bring the gym back. The restoration became a community effort,
      with many people stepping in and contributing in different ways.

    <h2>Restoration and Community Work</h2>
    <p>
      As restoration began, progress came together through steady effort. A new roof was installed to stop further water
      damage. Plumbing was repaired and updated with help from local businesses that donated fixtures and labor. A modern
      heating system was added, making the building usable year round. Energy efficient lighting was installed to
      brighten the interior and bring the gym back into regular use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members of the Bly Community Action Team supported the coordination that kept the project moving. Volunteers
      cleaned, repaired, painted, and restored the building piece by piece. Donations of time, materials, and funds made
      each improvement possible. Quentin's involvement fit into this wider effort and was shaped by the commitment of
      everyone who contributed.
    </p>

    <h2>A Legacy for Future Generations</h2>
    <p>
      Today the Ruth Obenchain Recreation Center serves many roles for the town of Bly. It offers membership access to
      the weight room and gym, provides space for community events such as celebrations, weddings, funerals, and
      reunions, and can serve as an emergency shelter when needed. Its revival stands as a clear example of what steady
      work and shared commitment can accomplish in a small community.
    </p>

    <h2>Join the Journey</h2>
    <p>
      The Ruth Obenchain Recreation Center continues to grow with the help of donors, volunteers, and members. Whether
      you are here to use the facilities, attend an event, or learn about the building's history, you are part of its
      ongoing story. Continued support helps ensure the recreation center remains a valuable resource for Bly for years
      to come.
