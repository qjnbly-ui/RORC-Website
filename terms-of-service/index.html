      By purchasing a membership, signing a contract, entering the facility, or using any services provided by RORC, you
      acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to all terms outlined herein.
    </p>
    <p>
      This agreement applies to all members, open gym participants, renters, guests, and guardians of minors.

      children (under 18) residing at the same primary address.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional adults residing in the same household may be added to a Family Membership only with approval from RORC
      management and are subject to an additional $15 monthly fee per adult.

    <p>
      RORC reserves the right to verify household residency and deny or revoke additional adult access if eligibility
      requirements are not met.
